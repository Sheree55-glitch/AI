Summary
A home-based AI system that uses voice, movement, and daily routine pattern recognition to monitor the well-being of elderly individuals living alone — offering alerts, companionship, and early warnings for caregivers.
Building AI course project

Background
Loneliness and undetected health issues are common among the elderly, especially those living alone. Falls, skipped meals, or sudden behavioral changes can go unnoticed for hours or days. This project aims to support aging-in-place by providing a lightweight AI companion that learns a person's routine and alerts caregivers when unusual patterns occur.

Motivation:

My grandmother lives alone and often forgets to take medication.

Monitoring systems exist, but many are invasive or too complex for daily use.

There’s a growing aging population globally, so scalable solutions are needed.

Problems it addresses:

Undetected falls or health changes

Social isolation

Missed medication or meals

Lack of timely alerts for family or caregivers
